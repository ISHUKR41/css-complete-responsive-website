          <div class="name">Microsoft updates Recall feature after security and privacy backlash</div>
          <div class="tag">Web Designer</div>
          <p class="about">Microsoft announced Friday that it is making changes to a new feature called “Recall,” turning it into an opt-in experience and adding more layers of security after experts raised concerns about the AI-powered tool unveiled last month.

            Recall, which is rolling out as part of Microsoft’s new Copilot+ PCs initiative, takes regular screenshots of user activity on the machine, creating an index that can be queried using AI.
            
            The feature received pushback from security and privacy leaders. Signal President Meredith Whittaker said the feature was a “dangerous honeypot for hackers.”
            
            “We are updating the set-up experience of Copilot+ PCs to give people a clearer choice to opt-in to saving snapshots using Recall,” Microsoft exec Pavan Davuluri wrote in a blog post Friday. “If you don’t proactively choose to turn it on, it will be off by default.
            
            The company also added new safeguards, including proof of presence to view a user’s timeline and search in Recall, and “just in time” decryption.
            
            The Copilot+ PCs initiative combines Microsoft’s Copilot artificial intelligence technologies and its Windows PC operating system.

          <p>Microsoft is looking to take advantage of interest from end users to fuel demand for its Azure cloud platform in competition with Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services.
            
            Some of the capabilities are similar to those shown by Microsoft partner OpenAI last week. Microsoft’s direct integration of the AI features into Windows may be part of the reason that OpenAI is releasing its new ChatGPT desktop app on Apple Mac computers despite working closely with Microsoft on AI technologies.
            
            OpenAI’s GPT-4o AI model will be available as part of Microsoft Copilot, the company said.
            
            Microsoft says sensitive personal data will be kept local and secure on the user’s device, including the index for a new feature called “Recall” that helps users find and access content. The company says the Copilot + PCs will be secured by default using its Pluton security chip architecture.
            
            The company has come under intense pressure to reform its security practices after a series of high-profile breaches. Microsoft recently unveiled new security protocols and benchmarks for executive compensation tied to security progress. Google on Monday released a security white paper and offer to Microsoft customers in an effort to take advantage of the Redmond company’s security vulnerabilities</p>

          <div class="name">Seattle startup Sanctum is developing private pods where solo travelers can work, rest, or relax</div>
          <div class="tag">Web Designer</div>
          <p class="about">Stuck in an airport due to a layover or flight delay, people seeking a place to work or rest grapple with limited and elusive options — a seat at the gate, a table in the food court, a spot at the bar, a shared counter in the concourse, or a chair in the lounge, if they’re lucky. And good luck finding anything resembling peace and quiet.

            A fledgling Seattle-based startup wants to give solo travelers a sanctuary instead.
            
            The company, Sanctum, is developing pods with doors that provide fully enclosed, private spaces, with a cocoon-like spherical shape. They feature seats designed for napping or working, with built-in ventilation, electrical and USB charging ports, and other planned amenities for both relaxation and productivity.
            
            The idea is to give people a private space on the go, paid for by the minute.<br>Based inside CoMotion Labs at the University of Washington, the company was started by hospitality industry veteran Juriana Spierenburg, Sanctum’s CEO and co-founder, who works as area hotel manager at citizenM hotels in Seattle. 
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="back-face">
          <h1>Job Description</h1>
          <p> She has been joined by Jason Koo, who is CTO and co-founder. The founders met at a GeekWire event last year.

            Sanctum’s goal is to deploy the prototypes initially at airports as a proof of concept, to gather feedback from users. Ultimately, the company also plans to roll out the pods in gyms and co-working spaces in urban areas. Other possibilities being explored by the company include offering the pods as workspaces for journalists at the 2026 FIFA World Cup.
            
            Spierenburg was inspired to pursue the idea based on her own experience traveling solo in different cities and continents, during which she personally experienced problems that solo travelers face — high and fluctuating accommodation costs, lack of flexibility in accommodation options, and safety/security concerns.
            
            “What I feel very strongly about is the flexibility of providing a space where you can relax or work,” Spierenburg explained. “And I feel very strongly about individual costs for solo travelers.”
            
            The pricing will consist of an unlocking fee and a pay-per-minute model similar to bike-sharing, to give users more control over how much they pay.</p>

          <div class="name">Third time’s the charm! Boeing’s Starliner capsule begins first crewed space mission</div>
          <div class="tag">Web Designer</div>
          <p class="about">Two NASA astronauts were sent into space today to begin the first crewed flight of Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft, making a shakedown cruise to the International Space Station and back after years of costly setbacks and two scrubbed countdowns.

            United Launch Alliance’s Atlas V rocket lifted off from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida at 10:52 a.m. ET (7:52 a.m. PT), sending Starliner and its crew — NASA’s Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams — to the International Space Station.
            
            “Let’s get going,” Wilmore told Mission Control just before launch. “Let’s put some fire in this rocket.”
            
            The Atlas V rose smoothly into a mostly sunny sky, and within minutes, the gumdrop-shaped capsule separated from the rocket’s Centaur upper stage to continue its rise to orbit.<br>Two bold NASA astronauts are well on their way on this historic first test flight of a brand-new spacecraft,” NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said in a post-launch statement. “Boeing’s Starliner marks a new chapter of American exploration.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="back-face">
          <h1>Blog details</h1>
          <p>Boeing’s effort to get Starliner ready to carry astronauts has suffered through a string of delays and roughly $1.5 billion in cost overruns (which Boeing has had to cover under the terms of its decade-old $4.2 billion fixed-price contract with NASA).

            Two earlier attempts over the past month to launch this Crew Flight Test, or CFT, were due to problems with the Atlas V launch system rather than with Starliner. The first attempt was called off on May 6, two hours before liftoff, due to concerns about a valve on the Atlas V’s Centaur upper stage. The second try was scrubbed on June 1, with less than four minutes left in the countdown, when an alarm was triggered due to a faulty power supply in one of the launch control computers.
            
            United Launch Alliance’s team replaced the hardware and verified that the system was “good to go,” in the words of the company’s CEO, Tory Bruno. ULA, Boeing and NASA then gave the go-ahead for today’s countdown. “As you might imagine, there’s lots of pressure to just go,” Bruno said in a posting to the X social-media platform. “But that’s not what we’re here for.”
            
            Starliner had previously been through two uncrewed flight tests — an initial test that fell short of full success in 2019, and a do-over that reached the space station and met its objectives in 2022.</p>

          <div class="name">Seattle federal jury says Boeing should pay $72M to Zunum Aero in trade secrets case</div>
          <div class="tag">Web Designer</div>
          <p class="about">A federal jury in Seattle says Boeing owes an unsuccessful electric-aviation startup called Zunum Aero $72 million for misappropriating trade secrets and interfering with its business plans.

            Some of that amount could be tripled if the judge determines that the misappropriation was willful and malicious.
            
            “Zunum Aero’s founders and other shareholders are pleased that the company had the opportunity to prove its case, and that the jury agreed,” Scott Danner of the law firm Holwell Shuster & Goldberg, lead counsel for Zunum, said in a statement. “After years of fighting, the jury’s verdict is a tremendous vindication.”
            
            Boeing said it would challenge the judgment. “Boeing respectfully disagrees with the jury’s verdict, which is not supported by the law or the facts,” the company said.
          </p>

        <div class="back-face">
          <h1>Blog details</h1>
          <p>Bothell, Wash.-based Zunum Aero, which was founded in 2013, came out of stealth in 2017 and received millions of dollars in seed funding from Boeing and from JetBlue’s technology ventures fund. The company also won an $800,000 grant from the Washington State Department of Commerce’s Clean Energy Fund.<br>At the time, Zunum said it expected to put the first planes in a line of regional hybrid-electric and all-electric aircraft into service in the 2020s. In 2018, it selected Safran Helicopter Engines to provide the engine turbine for its 12-seat hybrid-electric aircraft. But less than a year later, the startup had to cut back on operations due to a cash shortage.

            In 2020, Zunum filed suit in King County Superior Court, alleging that Boeing stole the startup’s trade secrets and interfered with its efforts to work with Safran and bring in additional investment. That lawsuit was moved to federal court and went to trial this month.
            
            During the trial, Boeing’s attorneys argued that the aerospace giant did its best to support Zunum, but that the startup missed deadlines and couldn’t match the claims it made for its technology. Boeing said it used Zunum’s technical information only for permissible purposes, such as to manage its investment.</p>

            <div class="name">Amazon’s departing cloud chief: Gen AI can be ‘one of the biggest opportunities AWS has ever seen’</div>
            <div class="tag">Web Designer</div>
            <p class="about">Three years after returning to Amazon Web Services to lead the cloud giant through one of the most challenging and prosperous periods in its history, Adam Selipsky fielded questions this week about his tenure as AWS CEO, the state of competition in the cloud, and what’s next for himself and the company.

              In an interview with GeekWire at Amazon’s re:Invent building in Seattle, in his final days as the tech giant’s top cloud executive, Selipsky took issue with the popular narrative that AWS under his leadership was caught off-guard by the rapid rise of generative artificial intelligence.
              “I think that story has much more sizzle and will likely generate more clicks than looking back at what actually happened in the history of generative AI,” Selipsky said, referring generally to what he characterized as the misperception that Amazon has been behind in the generative AI boom.
            </p>

            <h1>Blog details</h1>
            <p>The Information reported last year on an earlier delay in the AWS Bedrock AI platform, and missed AI investments.

              Demand for generative AI has emerged as one of the most promising areas of growth for major cloud providers, as businesses increasingly seek to train, deploy and run advanced AI models as part of their tech infrastructure.
              
              But as Selipsky pointed out, Amazon and other companies have been deeply immersed in AI and machine learning for many years. That goes back to long before OpenAI released ChatGPT in late 2022, sparking the generative AI boom.
              
              “I think our differentiated focus on security, on operational excellence, on taking the long-term view with customers, continues to set us apart,” Selipsky said this week. “And I think if we do our jobs, and we listen to customers carefully and innovate, that generative AI will be one of the biggest opportunities that AWS has ever seen.”
              
              While cautioning that AWS still needs to earn its success in this new era of the cloud — it’s “not our birthright,” as he put it — Selipsky said the company’s work with customers over many years to bring their data into the cloud puts AWS in a position of unique strength.</p>

          <div class="tag">Web Designer</div>
          <p class="about">Seattle-based Climate Vault Solutions, a startup working to reduce carbon emissions, has raised $2.5 million in new investments.

            The business launched last year and takes a somewhat unusual approach to helping companies, organizations and individuals reduce their carbon emissions. Instead of paying for tree plantings or solar installations, Climate Vault buys cap-and-trade carbon pollution permits and “vaults” them so they can’t be used by polluters.
            
            Climate Vault Solutions is the sales and marketing arm of Climate Vault, Inc., which is a nonprofit initiative based in Chicago and founded in 2021.

            The non-profit was launched “to fix a broken supply chain in the voluntary carbon offset market and to spur innovation in carbon dioxide removal,” said co-founder Michael Greenstone, a distinguished University of Chicago professor in economics and energy policy.
            
            Total funding to date for Climate Vault is $11.9 million, according to spokesperson Brandy Gaskins.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="tag">Web Designer</div>
    <p class="about">Fifteen months after Microsoft started its journey to join forces with Activision Blizzard, another boss is now standing in its way.

      The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) issued a final decision Wednesday to prevent the tech giant from proceeding with the $69 billion deal, joining the U.S. Federal Trade Commission in formally opposing what would be the largest acquisition in the history of video games.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="back-face">
    <h1>Blog details</h1>
    <p>The CMA said Microsoft’s proposed remedies weren’t enough to overcome cloud gaming antitrust concerns.

      “The cloud allows UK gamers to avoid buying expensive gaming consoles and PCs and gives them much more flexibility and choice as to how they play,” the CMA said in a news release. “Allowing Microsoft to take such a strong position in the cloud gaming market just as it begins to grow rapidly would risk undermining the innovation that is crucial to the development of these opportunities.”</p>

    <div class="name">DoorDash vows to remove controversial consumer fee in Seattle if new minimum wage passes
    </div>
    <div class="tag">Web Designer</div>
    <p class="about">DoorDash for the first time has publicly promised to axe a $4.99 fee on consumer orders if the city passes a revised minimum wage law for delivery drivers.

      The company implemented the “regulatory response fee” for consumers in January after the city’s existing minimum wage law went into effect, saying it helped “cover the cost of these new regulations.”
      
      With the new fee in place, demand fell for DoorDash and Uber Eats, which also added its own $5 charge to each order.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="back-face">
    <h1>Blog details</h1>
    <p>Some drivers and restaurant owners then complained about the lack of orders on the platforms.

      After heavy lobbying from DoorDash and Uber, Seattle City Council President Sara Nelson proposed a new set of regulations in April that would lower the minimum wage standard for drivers from $26.40 per hour to $19.97.
      
      The council was set to vote on the legislation, CB 120775, last week but abruptly postponed the vote to consider amendments.
      
      DoorDash said in a blog post Wednesday that it “stands ready to remove the current Regulatory Response Fee in Seattle once the reform bill is enacted and operational costs reduced.”</p>

    <div class="tag">Web Designer</div>
    <p class="about">At the risk of beating a not-dead, just-missing zebra, here’s another story about the story that won’t quit this week.

      In case you’ve been off Facebook, X and nearly every other social media platform since last Sunday, an escaped zebra has been on the loose near North Bend, Wash. Four of the animals got out of a trailer that was headed to Montana, and one is still roaming around.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="back-face">
    <h1>Blog details</h1>
    <p>And based on internet posts relying on generative AI (like the image above) or Photoshop, the zebra could be grabbing a Dick’s burger, riding a ferry, assisting law enforcement, standing on the SR 520 bridge, hanging out with Bigfoot or tossing a fish at Pike Place Market.

      Now one Seattle television station’s social team is saying enough already with the zebra memes.
      
      The KOMO News #SoNorthwest Photography page posted a message to its 46,000 members Friday morning asking them to please stop sharing standalone zebra content.</p>

    <div class="name">‘Tomb Raider’ escape-room-style immersive attraction coming to downtown Seattle
    </div>
    <div class="tag">Web Designer</div>
    <p class="about">A new waterfront attraction in Seattle will bring the popular video game and film franchise “Tomb Raider” and its protagonist Lara Croft to life in an immersive, escape-room-style entertainment experience.

      Seattle-based Hourglass Escapes, under its new banner Hourglass Attractions, plans to open “Tomb Raider Experience Seattle: Escape from the Temple of Fire” this fall, the company announced Monday. The 4,000-square-foot facility at 1122 Post Ave. is blocks from Pike Place Market.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="back-face">
    <h1>Blog details</h1>
    <p>The experience promises to go beyond traditional escape room offerings, where visitors will join Croft on the exploration of a mysterious temple that has emerged from a volcano and help her protect a dangerous artifact hidden within its ancient walls.

      “Tomb Raider Experience Seattle” promises “scenic landscapes, heart-thumping adventures, challenging puzzles, and live actors all working together” over the course of about 90 minutes, with “pulse-racing action” that culminates in what Hourglass describes as “a thrilling, lava-soaked finale.”.</p>
